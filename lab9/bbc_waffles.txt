I was watching an American TV show recently and missed a lot of the plot, as I was distracted by the amount of waffle-eating going on. I tried to prevent myself getting a waffle iron; I’d made that mistake once before. Reader, I didn’t succeed. But I vowed that this time I wouldn’t use it once then consign it to a cupboard under the stairs, and I’ve been as good as my word and have turned into something of a weekend waffler. 

Method:
1. Heat the waffle iron according to instructions (some need to be lightly oiled before you start).
2. Pour the milk into a large measuring jug, add the egg yolks, oil and vanilla and beat together. Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Pour the jug of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ones and whisk together, making sure there are no lumps.
3. Put the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk to stiff peaks. Slowly fold the egg whites into the batter, until a thick, smooth and airy consistency is achieved.
4. Fill one side of your heated waffle iron with 250ml/9fl oz batter, close and cook for 1 minute, then turn the waffle iron over and cook on the other side for 2 minutes. If you’re using an electric waffle iron, you will obviously not be turning it over, so you may need to cook for a minute or so longer. Just follow the instructions that come with the iron in all cases.
5. Ease the cooked waffle out of the waffle iron. Repeat until all the batter is used up. If you’re not keeping the waffles warm in the low oven (see recipe tip) each waffle should be eaten as soon as it comes out of the iron. Generously pour maple syrup over your waffle, and tumble a few berries alongside if wished.
